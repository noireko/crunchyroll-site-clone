# Crunchyroll Clone

A personal project where I recreated the main interface of [Crunchyroll](https://www.crunchyroll.com), the popular anime streaming platform, using only **HTML**, **CSS**, and **vanilla JavaScript** — without any frameworks or external libraries.  
The goal was to **improve my front-end development skills** by replicating the visual style and user experience of the original site.

## Main Features

- **Fully functional anime carousels**, adapted for both **mobile and desktop**.  
- **Dynamic lighting effects:** the items visible in the carousel automatically highlight as you scroll.  
- **Responsive design** that adjusts perfectly to small, medium, and large screens.  
- **Visual style inspired by Crunchyroll**, with clean typography, color palette, and smooth transitions.  
- **Fluid interactivity** using pure JavaScript (no dependencies).  
- **Clean and scalable structure**, divided into sections like *Home*, *Genres*, and *New Releases*.

## Technologies Used

| Technology | Description |
|-------------|--------------|
| **HTML5** | Semantic and organized structure of the page |
| **CSS3** | Visual design, animations, and responsive layout |
| **JavaScript (vanilla)** | Carousel logic, animations, and interactivity |

## Responsiveness

The project was built with a **mobile-first approach**, meaning the experience was designed for mobile devices first, then expanded for larger screens.

- **Mobile:** 2 visible anime cards per carousel.  
- **Desktop:** 6 visible anime cards per carousel.  
- The visible cards automatically light up for a smoother browsing experience.

## What I Learned

While developing this project, I learned how to:

- Build horizontal carousels from scratch (without libraries).  
- Handle responsive design manually without CSS frameworks.  
- Organize a front-end project structure from zero.
